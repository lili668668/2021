What we've seen in these two cases is that if cross-chains are limited to a specific set of standards, then basically we're going to see one fragmented blockchain world after another, where you have your standard and I have my standard, and then we're going to have a fragmented blockchain world. However, since last year, with the heat up of DEFI, the ecosystem of the Ethereum public chain has become the strongest moat. This presentation will analyze how other new power chains, such as BSC, FANTOM, Near and Nervos, can complete cross-chain in the simplest user operation environment.

Apart from learning in OS textbooks, how can we experience the construction of an OS kernel and studying the relative system software? In this agendum, we will introduce a minimal OS kernel with GNU Toolchain and QEMU. It provides several features like time-sharing, multi-tasking, user-level thread, loading ELF dynamically, memory management, filesystem, stack overflow detection, etc. The whole system is composed of about 2K lines of code and can be run on Arm/AArch64 architecture (including Raspberry Pi 4B)."},"speakers":["WLAQ9S"],"tags":[],"co_write":null,"slide":null,"record":null},{"id":"DZMCHW","type":"za9tlm","room":"TR213","start":"2021-08-01T11:25:00+08:00","end":"2021-08-01T11:55:00+08:00","language":"漢語","zh":{"title":"MySQL 8 那麼久了，還沒開始用 window function 嗎？","description":"Window Function 是現代 SQL 很重要的功能，是早在其他 SQL 生態圈行之有年的重要功能。\r\nMySQL 則是在 8.0 終於正式推出這個功能，但似乎還不是很多 MySQL 的使用者知道它的存在，\r\n這個議程會跟大家分享 Window function 的核心概念與實務操作技巧與經驗，希望能幫助大家早日導入在開發的專案中。"},"en":{"title":"MySQL 8 那麼久了，還沒開始用 window function 嗎？","description":"Window Function is a very important function of modern SQL, and an important function that has been used for many years in other SQL ecosystems.\r\nMySQL finally officially launched this feature in 8.0, but it seems that not many MySQL developers know its existence.\r\nThis agenda will share with you the core concepts and practical operation skills and experience of Window function, hoping to help you introduce it into the development project as soon as possible."},"speakers":["TNXVVC"],"tags":[],"co_write":null,"slide":null,"record":null},{"id":"RRRPSB","type":"qda913","room":"TR211","start":"2021-07-31T11:45:00+08:00","end":"2021-07-31T12:30:00+08:00","language":"漢語","zh":{"title":"Create an NFT on Flow in 30 Minutes","description":"Create an NFT on Flow in 30 minutes"},"en":{"title":"Create an NFT on Flow in 30 Minutes","description":"Create an NFT on Flow in 30 minutes"},"speakers":["ZJFMCT"],"tags":[],"co_write":null,"slide":null,"record":null},{"id":"CPJKQM","type":"o1a6xs","room":"TR309","start":"2021-07-31T14:40:00+08:00","end":"2021-07-31T15:10:00+08:00","language":"漢語","zh":{"title":"SONiC: Opec source Network OS for Datacenter","description":"Switch State Service - Core component of SONiC which processes network switch data - The SWitch State Service (SWSS) is a collection of software that provides a database interface for communication with and state representation of network applications and network switch hardware."},"en":{"title":"SONiC: Opec source Network OS for Datacenter","description":"Switch State Service - Core component of SONiC which processes network switch data - The SWitch State Service (SWSS) is a collection of software that provides a database interface for communication with and state representation of network applications and network switch hardware."},"speakers":["989LAD"],"tags":[],"co_write":null,"slide":null,"record":null},{"id":"YMPHP8","type":"qda913","room":"TR211","start":"2021-07-31T15:15:00+08:00","end":"2021-07-31T16:00:00+08:00","language":"English","zh":{"title":"Scaling decentralized applications on Solana","description":"Solana has emerged as a top layer one blockchain for decentralized applications, especially in the DeFi industry.
